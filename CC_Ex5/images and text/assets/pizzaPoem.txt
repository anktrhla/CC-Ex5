sublime triangle
you aren’t equilateral 
a luscious isosceles
your geometry’s perfect
the way pepperoni lays like isles in mozzarella seas
under a bread mantle please

i ain’t good at math but i know the right answer to you + me

i want to devour you tip-to-tip end-to-end inside and out
til i reach your crust

and i must

have you
